the `location` command allows you to associate names with coordinates, so that you can more easily teleport bots around. Here's how to use it:
`~location list` — list all of the locations that you have saved.
`~location add <name> <coordinates:x y z> [<dimension: overworld|nether|end>]` — saves a new location.
`~location edit <name> <coordinates:x y z> [<dimension: overworld|nether|end>]` — changes the coordinates that `name` refers to.
`~location delete <name>` — deletes the location.
`~location help` — give this help spiel.
