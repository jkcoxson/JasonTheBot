how to use the `server` command:
`~server status` — find out whether the server is on, running the game server, and who's currently playing on the server.
`~server start` — start the Minecraft game server so you can play.
`~server stop` — stop the Minecraft game server once everyone is done. Administrators can add `--force` to the end of the command (`~server stop --force`) to stop the server even if people are still online.
`~server kill` (administrators only) — this force kills the Minecraft game software. This should only be used as a last resort.
`~server help` — give this help spiel.
