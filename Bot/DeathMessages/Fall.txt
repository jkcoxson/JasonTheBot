forgot not to look down.
forgot to equip the elytra.
had a mean brother named Scar that pushed him off a cliff.
realized that the ground hurts from far up.
realized that his glass bridge was actually no bridge.

thought jumping off a cliff was a good idea.
forgot that gravity was still a thing.
believed in flying.
forgot to switch to a creative server before jumping off a cliff.
barely missed the Millennium Falcon as it tried to pick him up from Cloud City.
ended the same way Peter Parker's girl friend ended in Spider Man 2. Falling.
thought he saw diamonds at the bottom of a cliff.
