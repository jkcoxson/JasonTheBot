thought there was a penny at the bottom of a pool.
forgot he wasn't a fish.
was mining under the water for too long.
forgot to activate the conduit.
was trying to figure out if water was wet.
didn't Riptide out of a giant glass pool quick enough.
forgot how to swim.
couldn't get back to his boat in time.
